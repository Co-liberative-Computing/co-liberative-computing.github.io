In this event, we aim to critically explore the intersection of equity and justice in computing. Our motivation stems from the recognition that computing
is far from neutral - it intricately carries the values and biases of its creators. Here, we will uncover the layers of harm inflicted by data and algorithms rooted in
pre-existing systems of oppression at both individual and structural levels in our society and analyze how these algorithms, seemingly impartial, can 
exacerbate societal inequalities by amplifying, centralizing, privatizing, automating, and abstracting inequitable social systems.
Our overarching objective is to elevate researchers' critical consciousness of computing, equity, and justice. We aim to establish a direct and impactful 
link between the injustices in their lives and the technology they create. By fostering this connection, we seek to provoke a deep understanding of the 
ethical dimensions within the realm of computing. Join us on this transformative journey, where we collectively work towards increasing awareness, challenging 
assumptions, and contributing to a more equitable and just technological landscape.
