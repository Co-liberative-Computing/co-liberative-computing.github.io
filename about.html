<font color="#307D7E">Co-liberative Computing</font> is a research group at KTH Royal Institute of Technology that is deeply committed to promoting critical consciousness within the realms 
of computer science education and research. Acknowledging the inherent lack of neutrality in computing and its entanglement with societal oppression, our group places 
a significant emphasis on developing a keen critical awareness to identify and analyze these pervasive inequalities.
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-family:'Quattrocento';font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">
Our mission revolves around integrating justice and equity as foundational values in computer science research and education. The overarching goal is to ensure 
that our endeavors not only advance technological knowledge but also serve the greater good for all individuals, contributing to a more inclusive and just society.
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-family:'Quattrocento';font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">
At the core of our approach is the practice of co-liberation, grounded in the unwavering belief in a collective 'us'. This perspective recognizes the inseparable 
connection between our individual liberation and the imperative to collaborate for mutual freedom and the equitable redistribution of power. 
In the context of co-liberation, we advocate for a profound commitment to mutual benefit, underscoring the collective responsibility shared by both dominant and 
minoritized groups. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-family:'Quattrocento';font-size:20px;font-weight: bold;">
Through these principles, we aspire to contribute to a transformative and inclusive computing landscape, addressing systemic injustices and fostering a society where technology 
serves as a force for positive change. This perspective challenges the conventional view of computing services as mere charity, reframing them as powerful tools for building meaningful 
relationships and addressing demographic disparities.
