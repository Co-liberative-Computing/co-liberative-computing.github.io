<b>WASP-HS Workshop in conjunction with the conference <a href="https://wasp-hs.org/event/ai-for-humanity-and-society-2024/">AI for Humanity and Society 2024</a></b>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:20px;">
This workshop is dedicated to exploring the critical importance of identifying, acknowledging, and addressing biases – such as those related to gender, race, and culture – embedded within generative models like large language models (LLMs). These models are often trained on vast datasets from diverse sources and may inadvertently encode biases. As a result, the content they generate – ranging from text to images and audio – can perpetuate stereotypes, reinforce social inequities, and marginalize certain societal groups. Our workshop aims to raise awareness and discuss the multifaceted nature of bias on generative models, extending beyond textual content to include imagery and audio outputs in various contexts such as education, health care and so on. This diversity in generated content underscores the imperative to tackle biases to ensure ethical development effectively.

Participants in this workshop will engage in a series of activities:
<ul>
<li><p align="justify" style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:20px;"><b>Keynote talk:</b> A session discussing the latest research on biases in generative content, focusing on recent advancements and remaining challenges.</p></li>
<li><p align="justify" style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:20px;"><b>Short talks:</b> Accepted abstracts are presented in short talks, where speakers share their experiences and methodologies for addressing bias in generative models.</p></li>
<li><p align="justify" style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:20px;"><b>Hands-on group exercises:</b> Hands-on group exercises: Participants engage in practical exercises to practice identifying and mitigating biases directly within generative models.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:20px;">
We aim to facilitate discussions that raise awareness, pinpoint specific biases, and foster the understanding of comprehensive mitigation strategies to address them effectively, ultimately contributing to human beings' flourishing. Interactive discussions will enhance knowledge sharing among participants, enabling them to gain valuable insights into the ethical considerations and challenges inherent in developing and deploying generative models in diverse societal contexts.
