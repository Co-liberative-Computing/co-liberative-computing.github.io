In this event, we aim to critically explore how fairness and justice play out in the world of computers. Why? Because computers are not neutral – 
they carry the beliefs and biases of their creators. We want to uncover how data and computer programs linked to existing unjust systems can hurt 
individuals and whole communities. We will also explore how these programs can make existing inequalities even worse. Our goal is to make 
researchers more aware of the social issues tied to computers. We want them to see a direct link between the problems in their lives and the 
technology they create. By doing this, we hope to understand better the ethical side of research and education in computer science.

<p style="flex:1;" align="justify"><a href="https://www.kth.se/profile/khook">Kristina Höök</a>
<br>Kristina Höök is a professor in interaction design at KTH. Her research interests include affective interaction, somaesthetic design, internet of things and anything that makes life with technology more meaningful, enjoyable, creative and aesthetically appealing.</p>

<b>Title: Soma Design</b><br>
<b>Abstract:</b> Soma Design foregrounds the lived body of the designer, involving extensive bodily experience through personal practice. It entails an active stance, inviting us to seek out new bodily practices and, in its application within HCI, new digital technologies to support these. Soma Design therefore encourages us to design for deepening aesthetic appreciation and meaning-making from a position as sentient, subjective selves. Through engaging somatically with the digital and physical materials we design with, their somaesthetic potential is revealed and can be shaped into felt experiences relevant to the design aims.

<b>Title: New Vistas on Responsible Learning Analytics in Higher education: A Data Feminist Perspective</b><br>
<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, Teresa will examine what data feminism (D’Ignazio & Klein, 2020) can offer the education community working with learning analytics and artificial intelligence systems. 
She shares critical questions for further developing and enabling a responsible stance in education research and practice taking one particular case — algorithmic decision-making — as a point of departure.

<p style="flex:1;" align="justify"><a href="https://www.kth.se/profile/akpeters">Anne-Kathrin Peters</a>
<br>Anne-Kathrin Petters is an associate professor of technology education with focus on sustainability at KTH. Her main interest is the role of education and technology for change towards more just and sustainable ways of living, particularly in the intersection of 
social sustainability (equality, equity, democracy) and environmental sustainability.

<b>Title: Towards Just Futures Through Research and Eeducation in Computing</b><br>
<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, Anne will delve into the concept of justice at the intersection of environmental, economic, and social concerns, and discuss its significance for computing education and research. 
As a student, she has grappled with understanding computing and her place within it, prompting her to pursue education alongside computing studies. As a doctoral student in computing education, Anne has examined 
the norms and values generated within computing and education. Recognizing the longstanding research on norms, values, and power with minimal impact, she highlights the importance of addressing social inequities
 in computing. Anne notes that existing research often focuses on specific social groups like gender or race, while she sees norms, values, and power as problematic from a broader sustainability standpoint. Since
 her PhD defense in 2017, Anne has embarked on an interdisciplinary journey, exploring the role of technology, research, and education in fostering societal transformation towards just and sustainable futures. 
Engaging with communities such as computing for sustainability (ICT4S), gender research, futures studies, and education research, she aims to share insights gained from her academic journey and welcomes discussions
on how others can contribute to and expand upon her findings.
