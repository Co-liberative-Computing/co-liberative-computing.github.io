<b>Reading and Critical Review on Ghost Work</b>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:20px;">
For this assignment, please read the following book chapter and articles:<br>
1. Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein (ch. 7)<br>
2. The Data-Production Dispositif, Milagros Miceli et al., CSCW, 2022<br>
3. Methodological Considerations for Centering Workers' Epistemic Authority in AI Research, Milagros Miceli et al., 2025<br>
4. Platformization of Inequality: Gender and Race in Digital Labor Platforms, Isabel Munoz et al., CSCW, 2024<br>
After completing these readings, you are required to write a critical response addressing the following questions.<br>
<br>
<b>The Data-Production Dispositif</b><br>
1. The paper draws on Foucault's concepts of power, knowledge, and discourse. Explain how these three concepts are connected in the authors' analysis of data production. Use examples from the paper to illustrate your answer.<br>
2. The authors propose three strategies to counteract the data-production dispositif: fighting alienation, precarization, and surveillance. Select one of these strategies and discuss how it could be put into practice in real-world settings such as crowdsourcing platforms or business process outsourcing (BPO) companies.<br>
<br>
<b>Methodological Considerations for Centering Workers' Epistemic Authority in AI Research</b><br>
1. The authors describe four guiding principles of Workers' Inquiry as a Research Methodology (WIRM). Summarize each principle in your own words and discuss how it helps to challenge or counteract extractive research practices in AI.<br>
2. The paper highlights several tensions that emerged during the implementation of WIRM. Choose one of these tensions and explain how it influenced the research process, using details from the paper.<br>
<br>
<b>Platformization of Inequality: Gender and Race in Digital Labor Platforms</b><br>
1. The paper outlines six dimensions of inequality shaped by gender and race on digital labor platforms. Select one of these dimensions and explain how it is reinforced either by specific platform design features or by client behaviors. Support your answer with examples from the study.<br>
2. The authors describe several strategies freelancers use to cope with bias on Upwork. Summarize these strategies and discuss whether they ultimately challenge or reproduce the structural inequalities built into the platform.<br>
<br>
<b>Connections Between the Texts</b><br> 
1. If you were tasked with redesigning a digital labor platform or AI research practice, what concrete interventions could you draw from all three papers? Which interventions seem most feasible, and which most transformative?.<br>
