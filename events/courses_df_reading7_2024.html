<b>Reading and Implementation on Emotion and Embodiment</b>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:20px;">
For this assignment, please read the following book chapters and articles:<br>
1. Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein (ch. 3)<br>
2. Feminist HCI: Taking Stock and Outlining an Agenda for Design, Shaowen Bardzell, SIGCHI, 2010<br>
3. Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization, Jessica Hullman et al., IEEE Trans. Vis. Comput. Graph., 2011<br>
4. Entanglements for Visualization: Changing Research Outcomes through Feminist Theory, Derya Akbaba et al., IEEE Trans. Vis. Comput. Graph., 2024<br>
After completing these readings, please critical answer the following questions.<br>
<br>
<b>Based on paper [2], answer the following questions:</b><br>
1. Describe the six feminist interaction design qualities proposed in the paper (pluralism, participation, advocacy, ecology, embodiment, and self-disclosure) and explain how each quality could influence the design of an interactive system.<br>
2. The paper distinguishes between two types of feminist contributions to interaction design: critique-based and generative. Explain the difference between these two approaches and discuss the potential value of each for advancing the field of HCI.<br>
<br>
<b>Based on paper [3], answer the following questions:</b><br>
1. Identify and describe three rhetorical strategies used in narrative visualizations. Provide examples of how each strategy can shape user interpretation of a visualization.<br>
2. Discuss how cultural and individual viewing codes influence the interpretation of visualizations. How can designers address these differences to improve accessibility and clarity?<br>
<br>
<b>Based on papers [1] and [4], answer the following questions:</b><br>
1. Using the concept of entanglement, analyze Periscopicâ€™s Stolen Years visualization (discussed in Chapter 3 of Data Feminism). Identify the relationships and assumptions embedded within it.<br>
2. The paper describes "epistemic walls" as boundaries that limit how phenomena can be studied. Provide examples of such walls in visualization research and discuss how feminist epistemologies might help researchers overcome these limitations.<br>
