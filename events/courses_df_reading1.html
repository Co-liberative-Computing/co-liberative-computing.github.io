<b>Critical Reflections on Data Feminism and Feminism for the 99%</b>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-family:'Arial';font-size:20px;">
For this assignment, you will read the introduction and the first two chapters of the book Data Feminism, along with theses 1–10 of Feminism for the 99%. After completing these readings, you are required to write a critical response addressing the following questions:
<br><br>
<b>Intersectional Feminism in Data Science:</b> How do the authors of Data Feminism propose incorporating principles of intersectional feminism into data science? Discuss one example from the first two chapters that you find meaningful and explain why it is important.
<br><br>
<b>Power and Privilege in Data:</b> Reflect on how Data Feminism challenges traditional power structures in the creation and use of data. How do the authors argue for a more equitable approach to data analysis? How might these ideas be applied to a current data science issue you are familiar with?
<br><br>
<b>Feminism for the 99% and the Critique of Liberal Feminism:</b> In Feminism for the 99%, how do the authors critique mainstream liberal feminism? Identify at least two theses (from theses 1–10) that you found particularly compelling or controversial, and explain your reasoning.
<br><br>
<b>Connections Between the Two Texts:</b> Both Data Feminism and Feminism for the 99% offer critiques of current systems of power. How do these critiques align or diverge? Discuss how the themes in Feminism for the 99% might inform or challenge the approaches proposed in Data Feminism.
<br><br>
<b>Personal Reflection:</b> Consider your own research. How could the ideas from these readings influence the way you approach your research or teaching? Give specific examples from your field of study.
